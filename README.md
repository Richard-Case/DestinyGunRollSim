Destiny-Style Weapon Perk Roll Simulator

I'm creating this app in order to personally see just how difficult it is (in theory) to implement random weapon rolls into a game like Destiny.
I'm doing this because the lack of weapon rolls is one of my main points of frustration with Destiny 2, and I'm curious about what kind of work it takes to program that type of system.
